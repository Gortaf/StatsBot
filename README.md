## Adding this bot to your server
Simply click this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=729973342035247167&scope=bot&permissions=101440. Then select your server. 

## Features
StatsBot is a work in progress. It was made to give you tools to visualise stats from your discord server. Here's the current list of working features:

#### 1.\>help
the \>help command will send you a help message in your DMs to help you use StatsBot

#### 1.\>uptime
this command will show for how long the bot has been online and running. This is useful because if you had a poll going on when a restart happen, the poll is lost.

#### 2. \>poll

the \>poll command allows you to organise a poll accross your server. Simply follow this syntax:

>\>poll option0,option1,option2 time

where you can add up to 10 options, and time is the time before the poll is closed in seconds. When the poll is closed, the bot will process the data and post a pie chart like so:

#### 3. \>userstats

The \>userstats command will be a multipurpose command to retrieve data about a certain user. Currently the only implemented feature of this command is "messages"

#####   \>userstats messages

This command will retrieve the messaging data in the last 30 days from a specified user (if no user is specified, defaults to the one who used the command) and display stats for it. Simply follow this syntax:

>\>userstats messages @user

This will send stats from the user's messages in this format:

NOTE: you can add the keyword "private" at the end of this command to receive the results in your DMs

#### 4. \>serverstats

The \>serverstats command will be a multipurpose command to retrieve data about the server. Currently the only implemented feature of this command is "roles"

#####   \>serverstats roles

This command will retrieve the repartition of roles in your server and post a bar plot to visualize it. The default role of the server will not be counted. (Might add an optional argument in the future to count it). Each bar represent the percentage of users that have a specific role. The bar will have the same color as the role to make it more readable in servers with a large amount of roles.

NOTE: you can add the keyword "private" at the end of this command to receive the results in your DMs

#### 4. \>event

The \>event command allows you to create serverwide events, and allows users to opt in and be notified once they begin.


To create an event, use: 

>\>event create "The event name" Year/Month/Day/Hour/Minute

This will create an event message, where users can react to opt in, and be notified when it's time for the event to start (the notifications will be sent at the specified date/time you provided when using the command)


To cancel an event, simply use:
>\>event cancel "The event name"

Note that you can only cancel an event that you created. Also note that canceling an event also cancels the notification.

To list all the upcoming events in the server, simply use:
>\>event list

This will show all the upcoming events, with their scheduled date, and currently registered participants.

## Upcoming features
Any feature in that list isn't yet implemented. It only serves as a preview of what the next features of this bot will be

#### \>userstats (add more features)    [low priority]
\>userstats is already partially implemented with \>userstats messages, however this is supposed to be a multipurpose command, and as such more options will be implemented for this command. 

#### \>serverstats (add more features)   [low priority]
Same as for userstats.

#### \>opensuggest & \>suggest   [medium priority]
These command will work as a pair. Whenever the \>opensuggest command is used (with a title and time after which it closes) users will be able to suggest features in relation to your title with \>suggest. The bot will add a :+1: and :-1: reaction to the suggestion, allowing others to vote for or against it. When the suggestions are closed, the bot will compile stats from the suggestions and their votes to display a pie chart of the most voted suggestions.

Please note that these are just features that are already planned and in the work. Many more features not listed here will most likely be added.
